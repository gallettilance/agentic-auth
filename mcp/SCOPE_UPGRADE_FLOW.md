# MCP Dynamic Scope Escalation Flow - Unified Architecture

This implementation provides a secure dynamic scope escalation pattern for MCP servers integrated with a unified authentication and authorization system. Users start with minimal permissions and can request additional scopes on-demand through an intuitive chat interface.

## üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Overview**

The unified system consists of:
- **üîê Unified Auth Server** (Port 8002) - Handles OAuth, JWT, scopes, approvals, and admin dashboard
- **üì° MCP Server** (Port 8001) - Executes tools with scope-based authorization
- **ü¶ô Llama Stack** (Port 8321) - AI agent runtime with auth-agent integration
- **üåê Chat App** (Port 5001) - Web interface with streaming responses and approval UI

## üîÑ **The Complete Flow**

### **1. Initial Authentication (Minimal Scopes)**
- User visits chat app at `http://localhost:5001`
- Logs in with demo credentials or Google OAuth
- Receives JWT token with role-based auto-approved scopes
- Can access tools that don't require additional scopes

**Example Initial Scopes:**
- **Admin users:** All scopes auto-approved
- **Developer users:** `read:files` auto-approved
- **Regular users:** `read:files` auto-approved

### **2. Scope Detection & Authorization Error**
- When user attempts to use a tool requiring additional scopes (e.g., `execute_command`)
- Auth agent detects insufficient scopes in MCP server response
- Returns structured authorization error with upgrade information

**Authorization Error Response:**
```json
{
  "error_type": "authorization_error",
  "tool_name": "execute_command",
  "required_scope": "execute:commands",
  "current_scopes": ["read:files"],
  "approval_type": "admin_required",
  "user_email": "lgallett@redhat.com"
}
```

### **3. Chat App Authorization UI**
- Chat app detects authorization error during streaming response
- Switches from streaming content to approval UI:
  - **üîì Request Approval** button
  - **üìã Check Status** button
  - **üîÑ Retry Message** button (initially disabled)
- Authorization error persists in chat history for transparency

### **4. Scope Upgrade Request**
- User clicks "üîì Request Approval"
- Chat app makes POST request to `/api/upgrade-scope`
- Unified auth server evaluates approval policy:
  - **Auto-approve:** If user role allows (immediate token update)
  - **Admin approval:** Create approval request for admin review

### **5A. Auto-Approval Flow** ‚úÖ
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User
    participant Chat as Chat App
    participant Auth as Unified Auth Server
    
    User->>Chat: Click "Request Approval"
    Chat->>Auth: POST /api/upgrade-scope
    Auth->>Auth: Check user role & scope policy
    Auth->>Auth: Auto-approve based on role
    Auth->>Chat: {"status": "approved", "auto_approved": true}
    Chat->>User: ‚úÖ Auto-approved! Retry your request.
    Note over User,Auth: Immediate token update & retry
```

### **5B. Admin Approval Flow** ‚ö†Ô∏è
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User as User
    participant Chat as Chat App
    participant Auth as Unified Auth Server
    participant Admin as Admin Dashboard
    
    User->>Chat: Click "Request Approval"
    Chat->>Auth: POST /api/upgrade-scope
    Auth->>Auth: Create approval request
    Auth->>Chat: {"status": "pending_admin_approval", "request_id": "..."}
    Chat->>User: üìã Approval request submitted
    
    Admin->>Auth: GET /dashboard
    Auth->>Admin: Show approval queue
    Admin->>Auth: POST /api/approve/{request_id}
    Auth->>Auth: Update user session with new token
    Chat->>User: Status: ‚úÖ Approved (auto-update via polling)
```

### **6. Token Exchange & Retry**
- Upon approval (auto or admin), unified auth server generates new JWT with upgraded scopes
- User session automatically updated with new token
- "üîÑ Retry Message" button becomes enabled
- User clicks retry ‚Üí original command executes successfully with upgraded permissions

## üîê **Security Features**

### ‚úÖ **Role-Based Auto-Approval**
- Trusted users get immediate access to appropriate scopes
- Reduces friction while maintaining security boundaries
- All auto-approvals are logged for audit

### ‚úÖ **Dynamic Permission Escalation**
- Users only get permissions when needed
- Scopes accumulate over time (no re-approval needed)
- Time-limited approval requests (10-minute expiry)

### ‚úÖ **Integrated Admin Oversight**
- Real-time approval dashboard
- Clear context and justification for each request
- One-click approve/deny actions

### ‚úÖ **Seamless User Experience**
- Authorization errors handled gracefully in chat
- No manual token copying or external redirects
- Persistent approval UI for transparency

## üéØ **Available Scopes & Tools**

| Scope | Risk Level | Tools | Auto-Approve Roles |
|-------|------------|-------|-------------------|
| `none` | None | `get_server_info`, `health_check` | All users |
| `read:files` | Low | `list_files` | `user`, `developer`, `admin` |
| `execute:commands` | Critical | `execute_command` | `admin` only |
| `admin:users` | Critical | User management tools | None (always requires approval) |

## üõ†Ô∏è **Testing the Complete Flow**

### **1. Start the Demo Environment**
```bash
./start_demo.sh
```

### **2. Test Auto-Approval (User ‚Üí read:files)**
1. Login as `lgallett@redhat.com` 
2. Try: "List files in the current directory"
3. Should auto-approve and execute immediately

### **3. Test Admin Approval (User ‚Üí execute:commands)**
1. Try: "Execute the command 'ps aux | head -5'"
2. Should show approval UI
3. Click "Request Approval" 
4. Open admin dashboard in new tab
5. Login as `gallettilance@gmail.com`
6. Approve the request
7. Return to chat and click "Retry Message"
